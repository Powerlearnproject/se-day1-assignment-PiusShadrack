Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles and methods to develop and maintain high quality software systems that act as solutions as per the given problem

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. Development of Programming languages
2. The establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s
3. The advent of structured programming in the 1970s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirements:- This is where we gather the user needs and requirements of the expected system
2. Design:- Different designs are brought up for the system architecture and user interface
3. Implementation:- It involves writing code for the system according to the specifications
4. Testing:- Different tests are conducted to ensure that the system meets quality standards and its functional requirements
5. Deployment:- Involves releasing the software to the users or customers
6. Maintenance:- Involves providing ongoing support, including updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall Methodology: It is a sequential approach with distinct phases like requirements and design, which flow downwards like a waterfall. Teams cannot advance from one phase of the SDLCC to the next until the current phase is complete
Examples: Manufacturing a complex machinery component
Agile methodology: It is an iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration and responding to change. Agile teams complete one sprint before moving into the next one. Requirements can change at any time in the project based on changing business needs or customer feedback
Example: Developing a new mobile app

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer: Is the one responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions
Quality Assurance Engineer: He/She ensures good software quality by designing and executing test plans
Project Manager: Is in charge of overseeing the planning, execution, and the delivery of software projects

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments: They provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging and testing code. Example is Visual Studio Code
Version Control Systems: They are good for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members. Example is Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. Changing Requirements: Sometimes requirements may change during the development cycle, which may lead to scope creep and project delays.
2. Tight Deadlines: Pressure to deliver software products on schedule which may result in rushed development hence compromise quality.
3. Technical Debt: They can impede or intefere with future development efforts and increase maintenance costs.
Strategies to Overcome The Challenges
1. Effective communication
2. Agile methodologies
3. Regular reassessment of project goals and timelines

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit Testing: Involves testing individual components or modules of software.
   Importance: It is good for checking the performance of every individual component in the software system.
2. Integration Testing: Involves testing the interactions between different components or subsystems.
   Importance: Good for checking whether the different components can interact well with each other
3. System Testing: This involves testing the entire software system as a whole.
   Importance: Helps to check whether the entire system perfomes as expected
4. Acceptance Testing: It involves testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets the user needs.
   Importance: Helps to check whether the developed software works well as per the user requirements

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering refrs to the aspect of crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models
Importance:
1. It helps to get more clear and specific responses from the AI models
2. It helps to avoid getting confusing answers

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Question:
Tell me more about cats
Improved question:
Tell me more about the history of domestic cats
The improved prompt is more effective as it helps to get better and clear responses from the AI model
